![Visitors](https://hitscounter.dev/api/hit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsohag1192%2FEmby-Home-Swiper-UI&label=Visitors&icon=github&color=%23198754&message=&style=flat&tz=UTC)

A lightweight, responsive, and visually engaging banner carousel for Emby and Jellyfin home screens. This plugin replaces the default library grid with a dynamic Swiper-based UI — perfect for showcasing featured content, recent additions, or branded visuals.

> ✅ Tested on Emby Web 4.9.1.80  
> ✅ Inspired by [Nolovenodie/emby-crx](https://github.com/Nolovenodie/emby-crx)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Download the script**  
   Get `home.js` from the [v1 folder](https://github.com/sohag1192/Emby-Home-Swiper-UI/tree/main/v1)

2. **Place in Emby environment**  
   Copy `home.js` to your Emby server’s custom scripts or plugin folder.

3. **Inject into dashboard**  
   Add this line to your Emby dashboard HTML or use a browser extension like Tampermonkey:

   ```html
   <script src="/path/to/home.js"></script>
   ```

---

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

- Open browser console (`F12`) and check for errors.
- Confirm Emby API is available:

  ```js
  console.log(ApiClient)
  ```

- Ensure you're on the correct route: `#!/home`
- Manually initialize the swiper:

  ```js
  HomeSwiper.init()
  ```

## 🧩 Developer Notes

This module uses global objects like `ApiClient` and `require(["toast"])` to interact with Emby’s internal API and UI components. Functions like `saveUser` and `renderMediaFolders` suggest future expansion for user-specific customization and folder visibility controls.
